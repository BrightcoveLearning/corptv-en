    <h2 id="What_is_{{ site.product_underscore }}">What is {{ site.product }}?</h2>

    <p>{{ site.product }} is a platform which enables you to create and configure a single media streaming experience which is then used across multiple devices. With {{ site.product }} you can curate your content, implement monetization strategies, and design viewer experiences. In doing so, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Greatly reduce overall costs. The costs of developing apps for each platform are considerable, anywhere from $50K-$250K for a custom app targeted at just ONE platform. {{ site.product }} allows creation of multiple apps from a single
        configured experience.</li>
      <li>Provide a consistent experience for viewers across all platforms.</li>
      <li>Allow monetization of video content via options like AVOD and SVOD.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Apps can be generated to run on the following four device types (some specific examples included):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mobile (Phone / Tablets)
        <ul>
          <li>Android</li>
          <li>iOS</li>

          <li>Apple TV</li>
          <li>Fire TV</li>
          <li>Roku</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Smart TVs
        <ul>
          <!-- <li>LG</li> -->
          <!-- <li>Panasonic</li> -->
          <li>Samsung</li>
          <li>Sony</li>

                <li>Playstation</li>
                <li>XBOX</li>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable"><sup>*</sup> {{ site.product_short }} supports the Android TV operating system. {{ site.product }} support is not attached to a specific brand. As long as a device runs Android TV with Google Services enabled, it's expected to be supported. Brightcove does not test every single Android TV device, but it is expected that devices that properly support the operating system will also support {{ site.product }}.</aside>
    <p>Not only do you get multiple device apps from a single source, but {{ site.product }} also allows you to control the content and layout for each device app from your single {{ site.product }} Experience.</p>

    <p>Your specific device apps are submitted initially to vendors for approval, and only need to be resubmitted in very rare instances like an OS update. Of course, you will want to change the media that is offered for viewing, alter the app layout, or change your monetization for advertising strategy. This is done by altering the experience, which does NOT require a resubmission to a vendor store. The key to updating the app, but not having to resubmit to the vendor store, lies in the architecture of {{ site.product }} as shown here:</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">The diagram assumes you have, of course, downloaded and installed the {{ site.product }} app on a device.</aside>

    <p>This architecture provides the functionality to only alter the single {{ site.product }} Experience to update the layout or configuration of all your device apps.</p>
