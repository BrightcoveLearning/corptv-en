    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Closed captions can be added to videos to provide additional or interpretive information to individuals who wish to access it. Captions are necessary so the deaf and hard of hearing can access the audio portion of video presentations.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="Example of Captions" src="https://general.support.brightcove.com/assets/images/general/sample-captions.png" />

    <p>Such text may be used for accessibility, to provide translations of the audio track or some other purpose, but the underlying technology used is the same.</p>

    <h2 id="filelocation">Captions file location</h2>
    <p>You can choose where to host the WebVTT captions file:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>At a Remote URL (remote asset)</strong> - In this case, the WebVTT file is hosted on your server and you add the URL for the file to the video metadata.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If you are hosting captions files on your own server, make sure the file is located at a URL that can be accessed by the Brightcove player. The server hosting the captions file should also have Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled. You can read more about CORS <a href="https://general.support.brightcove.com/developer/concepts-cors.html">here</a>.</aside>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Uploaded using Brightcove Beacon</strong> (<strong>ingested</strong>) - In this case, the WebVTT file is uploaded (ingested)  using the  Media module.</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If the video source file you ingest into Brightcove Beacon has embedded 608/708 captions, they will be ignored during the processing of the video, and <strong>not</strong> present in the video renditions. To have captions with your videos, you have a few options:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/media/generating-captions-videos.html">Let Beacon generate caption files</a></li>
        <li><a href="/media/adding-captions-videos-using-media-module.html">Manually add captions</a></li>

  <section id="associate" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Associating captions with a video</h2>
    <p>There are several ways to associate a captions file with a video:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Using Studio</li>
      <li>Modifying the player publishing code</li>
      <li>Using the APIs</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="cap_gen">Automatically generating captions for videos</h3>
    <p>Beacon Studio can automatically generate captions for videos. For information, see <a href="/media/generating-captions-videos.html">Automatically Generating Captions for Videos</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="studio">Adding captions in Studio</h3>
    <p>Captions can be associated with a video using the Media module. For information, see <a href="adding-captions-videos.html">Adding Captions to Videos</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="pubcode">Modifying the player publishing code</h3>
    <p>In this case, a <code translate="no">&lt;track&gt;</code> tag is added to the player publishing code. For more information, see <a href="https://player.support.brightcove.com/general/adding-captions-videos-programmatically.html">Adding Captions to Videos Programmatically</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="api">Adding captions via the APIs</h3>
    <p>How you add captions via the APIs varies depending on whether the captions file will be ingested or used as a remote asset. </p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: No more than 1000 text tracks may be added.</aside>
  </section>
  <section id="remove" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Removing captions</h2>
    <p>Captions can be removed from videos using the Media module. In Studio, open the Media module and edit the video details. Click the <strong>Video and Tracks</strong> tab and then edit the <strong>TEXT TRACKS</strong> section as needed.</p>
