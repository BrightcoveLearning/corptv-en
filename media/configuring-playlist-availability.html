    <p>Playlist availability details can be used to restrict access to {{ site.product_short }} playlists based upon date, locations and devices. To view and edit the availability details for a {{ site.product_short }} playlist, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the <strong>Media</strong> module.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>All {{ site.product_short }} playlists</strong> in the panel navigation.</li>
      <li>Click on a playlist title to open the playlist details page.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Edit Settings</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click the <strong>Availability</strong> tab.</li>
    </ol>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/media/playlist-availability-settings.png" /></figure>
    <p>The availability settings are controlled using rule sets. All playlists must have at least one rule set. Rule sets are created to control access to a video based upon:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start/end dates</li>
      <li>Locations</li>
      <li>Devices</li>
    </ul>
