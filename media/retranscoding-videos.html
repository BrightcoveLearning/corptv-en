    <p>Brightcove reserves the right to update the default ingest profiles associated with Brightcove Beacon accounts. You may also have the need to update your own, custom ingest profiles. When ingest profiles change, you may wish to have existing videos in your account retranscoded so that they have renditions that correspond to the new ingest profile settings.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: You cannot retranscode videos that have been shared to your account.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: videos can only be retranscoded if the video master was archived when the video was added to the account. All <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/admin/standard-ingest-profiles-legacy-transcoding.html">Standard Ingest Profiles</a> will archive the master.</aside>

        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Videos that were initially transcoded using a Dynamic Delivery or Context Aware ingest profile can only be retranscoded using one of those ingest profile types. Videos transcoded using a Legacy ingest profile can be retranscoded with any type of profile.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Check <strong>Keep existing thumbnail and poster images</strong> to keep the existing images. If you uncheck this box, new images will be generated based upon the image settings in the selected ingest profile.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Retranscode</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
