    <p>Videos in your Brightcove Beacon account have associated poster, thumbnail, portrait, landscape and ultrawide images. These images allow viewers to pick which videos they want to see in a playlist or other listing of your content. Poster and thumbnail images can be seen in the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the Media module, the thumbnail image is displayed next to the video; the poster image will appear in the preview player on the video details page</li>
      <li>The thumbnail image will appear when publishing a playlist</li>
      <li>The poster image is displayed in the playback area of the video player after the player loads and the video metadata is available; the poster will display until the viewer presses the play button</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For videos that are uploaded to Brightcove Beacon, poster and thumbnail images are created automatically by taking a snapshot from the source video at the midway point. The size of the poster and thumbnail is based upon the dimensions specified in the ingest profile used when uploading the video. If you don't like the default images that were captured, you can upload other images or <a href="/media/capturing-poster-and-thumbnail-images.html">capture new images</a> to use as the poster and thumbnail.</p>
    <p>When uploading custom poster and thumbnail images, we recommend:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Poster image</strong> - Recommended aspect ratio of 16:9 and a minimum width of 640px</li>
      <li><strong>Thumbnail image</strong> - Recommended aspect ratio of 16:9 and a minimum width of 160px</li>
      <li><strong>Landscape image</strong> - Recommended aspect ratio of 16:9</li>
      <li><strong>Portrait image</strong> - Recommended aspect ratio of 2:3</li>
      <li><strong>Ultrawide image</strong> - Recommended aspect ratio of 21:9
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Uploaded images should use the sRGB color format.</aside>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you upload new poster and thumbnail images, the image dimensions will be based upon the image dimensions specified in the default ingest profile for the account. For information on increasing the quality of poster and thumbnail images, see <a href="/media/increasing-quality-poster-and-thumbnail-images.html">Increasing the Quality of Poster and Thumbnail Images</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="Limitations">Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The ingestion system does not allow concurrent jobs on the same video. Therefore, if you attempt to upload images while the video is being ingested or retranscoded, the image upload will fail.</li>
    </ul>
