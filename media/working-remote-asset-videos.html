    <p>Typically, videos are uploaded to Brightcove Beacon using the Upload module. These files are then maintained by Brightcove. With remote assets, you maintain your video files on your own or a third-party system and then provide Brightcove Beacon with the URL of the video file. </p>

    <h2 id="access">Accessing remote assets</h2>
    <p>All of your remote asset files must be available at a public URL without any requirements for authentication or access control. If your remote assets are hosted by a CDN, the URL of the remote assets should be the URL of the assets in the CDN and not the URL on the origin server.</p>

    <h2 id="limitations">Remote asset limitations</h2>
    <p>The following are limitations you should be aware of when using remote asset videos: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>SSAI is not supported for remote assets.</li>
      <li>DRM is supported only if you can customize the player to communicate with the DRM license server. This is possible with the Brightcove Player through a plugin. For other players, you will need to consult the player documentation.</li>
      <li>All videos ingested into Video Cloud can be played back in the Brightcove Player. For non-Brightcove players, which is you will mostly encounter in Brightcove Beacon, you will need to verify that the video format is fully supported by each platform. Also, there are a few advanced features of DASH and HLS that Brightcove do not yet support </li>
    </ul>
